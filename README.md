# InstallQuorum_DeployContract
This is Exercise 19 from MI4 in Kingsland Universities Blockchain Developer Program.

# Overview
The goal of this exercise is to install and setup **Quorum**. Quorum is a **permissioned blockchain software** based on
Ethereum. This is ideal for private entities and enterprise cases that want some kind of user-access control for the
blockchain network. This open-source development effort is headed by J.P. Morgan and Microsoft.

# Goals
• Bring a Quorum node and multiple nodes online via Virtual Box and Vagrant.
• Interact with the Quorum nodes on the virtual machine using Quorum samples.

# Prerequisites
• GIT v2.26.0^ https://git-scm.com/downloads
• Virtual Box v6.1.2 https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_6_1
• Vagrant v2.2.7 https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.2.7/
